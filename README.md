# EE447-2021
This repo is consisting of 6 Preliminary Works and Term Project of EE447 Lecture at METU.

While doing all these stuffs, **assembly** language is used.

Keil uVision was our main program to embed all these works.

As a board, TM4C123GH6PM is used. Therefore, if you want to rotate a step motor or try to shine an LED on this board (or etc.) these repo would be useful for you.
